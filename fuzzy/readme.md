# Fuzzy homework in NCU
## Introduction
* This is a repository for my fuzzy study in NCU.
* To simulate different nonlinear functions, we choose different fuzzy sets to establish a fuzzy system, and use fuzzy system to approximate the nonlinear function.
* The implementation method of fuzzy set comes from the `scikit-fuzzy` package.
## Requirements
    $ pip install numpy matplotlib
